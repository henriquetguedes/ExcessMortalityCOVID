## Excess mortality during COVID-19 in five different European countries and a critique of mortality surveillance data

This is a repository for data used in the aforementioned paper. Here you can find data for all five countries, total and subtotal deaths per day/week, which would enable you to replicate and better criticise our findings.

The methods used to work on these datasets are available on our paper (*awaiting publication*)
